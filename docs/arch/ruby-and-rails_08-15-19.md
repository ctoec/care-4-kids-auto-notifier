# Developing with Ruby on Rails

## Context
The development team needed to choose an application runtime. In conversation with United Way, they informed the team that they are a "Rails shop" and are only able to support Ruby and Ruby on Rails. The current version of Ruby on Rails is 5.2.

## Decision
The team decided to use Ruby and Ruby on Rails 5.2.

The team wanted to ensure that anything that was developed during the length of the contract would be maintainable in the long-term. Given United Way's requirements, the decision to use Ruby and Ruby on Rails was straightforward.

## Status
* Proposed
* Accepted
* Rejected
* Superceded
* __Accepted (Partially superceded)__

## Consequences
Application dependencies are limited to those in Gem packages.
